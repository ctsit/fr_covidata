# AUTHORS

REDCap First Responder COVID-19 would not be possible without generous contributions from our authors and funders.

Duane A. Mitchell, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the University of Florida Clinical Translational Science Institute, provides funding support for the UF CTSI REDCap team via UF CTSA Award and matching funds from the UF Office of Research.

The authors would like to thank Adrian Tyndall, M.D., Interim Dean, College of Medicine, Lisa Merck, MD and Derek Merck, Ph.D. of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of Florida for recognizing the need and driving the ideas for the creation of this software. The authors would also like to thank J. Glenn Morris, M.D., MPH, Director of the Emerging Pathogens Institute and John Lednicky, Ph.D. and Julia Gibson of the Department of Environmental and Global Health for their lab facilities used to support processes to share data consumed by the software. Additionally, the authors want to thank Cindy Montero, the research coordinator for Lisa Merck for her help with sample and label logistics produced by the software. The authors would like to thank Wendy Swan, MSN, RN, NE-BC, for her coordination of ED nursing staff to support workflows necessary for the COVID-19 testing process to be fully realized for the software.

The authors would like to particularly thank Robert I. Coulautii, Ph.D., of the Biology Department at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada for the use of their baRcodeR software (https://github.com/ropensci/baRcodeR). Their less than 24-hour response to a pull request to modify their R package to accommodate our label printing needs for this project was a critical part of making the software workflow a success.
